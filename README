Argeo Third Parties provides a consistent distribution of third party Java/OSGi bundles inspired by the approach of the various GNU/Linux distributions (especially Debian and Red Hat Enterpise Linux).

OSGi metadata are systematically regenerated, even when available in the upstream binaries, in order to work around some issues and to provide consistent SPDX license identifiers in the Bundle-License MANIFEST headers (cf. http://spdx.org/licenses)

## Build
In order to download and repackage the bundles:

git clone http://git.argeo.org/gpl/argeo-tp.git --recursive
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/
./argeo-tp/configure

cd argeo-tp
make clean all

Downloaded binaries are cached in:
~/.cache/argeo/build/origin
which can be purged at any time (binaries will be downloaded again).

Packaged bundles are available under:
../output/a2

The *.target files under ./sdk can then be used within the Eclipse IDE (with the PDE OSGi development extensions).

## Descriptors
The descriptors for the repackaging in (extended) BND format are available under:
./repackage

## Acknowledgements
